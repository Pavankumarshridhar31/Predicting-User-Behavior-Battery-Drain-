This project, Predicting User Behavior & Battery Drain, analyzes mobile device usage patterns using a dataset of 700 samples. It examines key metrics such as app usage time, screen-on time, battery drain, and data consumption to classify user behavior into five categories. Machine learning models are employed to predict battery drain based on usage patterns. The project aims to provide insights into user habits, optimize battery performance, and enhance mobile experience. Various classification and regression techniques are explored to improve prediction accuracy
